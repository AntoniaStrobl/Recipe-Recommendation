# Text Similarity Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation of a text similarity analysis tool. The tool compares a search document against a corpus of other documents using three similarity measures: Dot product, Euclidean distance, and Cosine similarity.

## Usage

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Update the sample documents and search document in the code file (`text_similarity_analysis.py`) according to your requirements.

2. Run the code to perform the text similarity analysis.

## Code Structure

- `text_similarity_analysis.py`: Contains the implementation of the text similarity analysis tool.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the tool and instructions for usage.
